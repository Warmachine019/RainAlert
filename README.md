# RainAlert
Gives weather predictions straight to your phone using the OpenWeatherMap API and sends a message to your phone using Twilio.

Replace the information in "main.py" with your desired information from twilio and OpenWeatherMap. The code checks if there is a chance of rain 12 hours after the code is run and if there is a chance of rain, a message is sent to the specified phone number telling them  to carry their umbrella. The process can be automated using PythonAnywhere and sensitive information can be stored using the environment variables.
